        <p>
            In many parts of Ghana and elsewhere in West Africa,<br>
            A person's name is determined by the day of the week<br>
            On which they were born. Akan names are derived<br>
            From the Ghanian Culture. This webpage takes<br>
            Your date of birth as input and outputs<br>
            Your Akai name based on the day you were born.<br>
