        <p>
            In many parts of Ghana and elsewhere in West Africa,<br>
            a person's name is determined by the day of the week<br>
            on which they were born. Akan names are derived<br>
            from the Ghanian Culture. This webpage takes<br>
            your date of birth as input and outputs<br>
            your Akai name based on the day you were born<br>
        </p>
